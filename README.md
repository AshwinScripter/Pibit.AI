# Resume PDF to JSON Converter

This Python script extracts text and hyperlinks from a PDF resume, parses it into structured data, and saves the result as a JSON file. It utilizes PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDF handling and regular expressions for parsing.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction:** Extracts text content from each page of the PDF resume.
- **Hyperlink Extraction:** Retrieves hyperlinks embedded in the PDF and associates them with the relevant resume sections.
- **Resume Parsing:** Parses the extracted text into structured data for Contact Information, Education, Experience, Skills, Projects, and Publications.
- **JSON Output:** Saves the parsed resume data along with associated hyperlinks as a JSON file.

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Clone the repository and install dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install PyMuPDF
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python pdf_to_json.py
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Enter the path to the PDF resume when prompted.
   - Enter the directory path where you want to save the JSON output.

3. **Output:**
   - The parsed resume data, including extracted hyperlinks, will be saved as `resume.json` in the specified directory.

## Example

Suppose you have a PDF resume located at `/path/to/resume.pdf` and you want to save the JSON output to `/output/directory/`. Hereâ€™s how you would run the script:

```bash
python pdf_to_json.py
```

- **Input:**
  ```
  Please enter the path to your PDF resume: /path/to/resume.pdf
  Please enter the directory path to save the JSON file: /output/directory/
  ```

- **Output:**
  ```
  JSON file saved successfully at: /output/directory/resume.json
  ```

Adjust the paths and instructions based on your specific use case and file locations.

## Dependencies
